description: The 3rd Workshop on Sign Language Recognition, Translation and Production
---

Sign languages are visual languages and a key form of communication for Deaf
communities. Thanks to recent advances in deep learning and computer vision and the avail-
ability of larger datasets, significant progress has been made in sign language technologies.
Following the first and second editions, this workshop is motivated by the desire to broaden
participation in sign language research from the computer vision community. It aims to
bring together researchers working on different aspects of vision-based sign language re-
search and sign language linguists to explore recent advances and future directions in sign
language recognition, translation, and production.

The workshop will consist of invited talks and a challenge on sign language production.
We have seen an increase in Sign Language Production (SLP) approaches over the last few
years. However, the lack of standardised evaluation metrics for SLP approaches hampers
meaningful comparisons across different systems. Therefore, this challenge aims to stan-
dardise SLP evaluation and representation to enable fairer comparison. It will be conducted
using a benchmark dataset and feature a leaderboard.
